To install Yarn for a GitHub project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: Yarn requires Node.js. If you haven't installed Node.js yet, download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Yarn**: You can install Yarn globally using npm (which comes with Node.js). Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install --global yarn
   ```

3. **Clone the GitHub Repository**: If you haven't cloned the project repository yet, do so by running:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of the GitHub repository.

4. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

   Replace `<project-directory>` with the name of the cloned repository folder.

5. **Install Project Dependencies**: Run the following command to install the project dependencies specified in the `package.json` file:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

This will set up all the necessary packages for the project using Yarn. You can now run or build the project as specified in its documentation.
